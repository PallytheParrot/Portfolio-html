<h2>According to Pal</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>1. Avengers Infinity War</h3>
<p>This movie is special to my heart because of its fast pace and starting of an amazing event. </p>
<h3>2. Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p> This movie had some of the greatest moment in the history of cinema, it was an end of our two of the greatest avengers of all time and that Avengers assemble when cap weilded mijolnir is just awesome</p>
<h3>3. Spiderman no way home</h3>
<p>This movie gave everyone nostalagic feeling. It had all of the three spidermans and some great villans of genz and millenial's childhood and that conversation between tobey maguire, andrew garfield, and Tom holland was just amazing.</p>
<h3>4. Iron Man</h3>
<p>This movie started the MCU and the way Jon fabreau started it was amazing all of the cgi was increadible and this movie didn't felt slow pace at any point. </p>
<h3>5. Thor Ragnarok</h3>
<p>Thor is my favorite Marvel character but his movies exept Ragnarok are all right but Ragnarok is special because of its comedy, CGI, character development, and story.</p>
